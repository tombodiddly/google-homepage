# google-homepage

This was my attempt at the google homepage assignment for The Odin Project. I learned that I have so much more to learn. There are likely an infinite number of better and more efficient ways to do this assignment. I clearly need to work on designing HTML structure and css classes/ids/etc. more intelligently. I was going to attempt (and may still...) to get the search bar looking sweet with the rounded shape, drop shadow, and icons using z-index.
