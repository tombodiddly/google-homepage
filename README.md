# google-homepage

This was my attempt at the google homepage assignment for The Odin Project. I learned that I have so much more to learn. There are likely an infinite number of better and more efficient ways to do this assignment. I clearly need to work on designing HTML structure and css classes/ids/etc. more intelligently. 


I totally frankensteined somebody else's code for the searchbar to get the sweet dropshadowy look. It's a bit screwy still but I think this was close enough if not a bit overboard for the first assignment...
